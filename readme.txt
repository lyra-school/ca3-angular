Firebase: https://webprog-ca3.web.app/ (on some browsers e.g. Firefox, you need to disable it from enforcing a secure connection otherwise you won't connect to the remote ExpressJS app)

EC2 server: http://3.254.131.124:5050/cars <- this will be different the next time the server is turned on, since it doesn't have a static IP
